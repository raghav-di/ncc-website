            <p className="abtc2txt">The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a tri-services organization comprising the Army, Navy, and Air Force. It was established in India in 1948 and can be traced back to the ‘University Corps’ which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917 with the objective of making up for the shortage of personnel in the Army. The NCC curriculum includes basic military training in small arms and drill, as well as community development and social service activities. The NCC has a strength of approximately 1 to 1.3 million cadets and is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. The NCC has played a crucial role in developing leadership qualities and discipline among young people in India. </p>
